1. Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusivity

As members of Group 42, working on the CPeptide–Diabetes Regression project, we are committed to building a collaborative, inclusive, and respectful environment. We welcome contributions from all team members regardless of background, identity, perspective, or experience.

We believe that diversity strengthens teamwork and leads to more ethical and impactful data science outcomes — especially when working with sensitive topics such as diabetes and biomedical data.

Our goal is to ensure every member of this project feels safe, valued, and empowered to contribute.
